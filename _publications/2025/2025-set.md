  Proposed a multi-input, multi-task deep learning model for rapid seismic analyses of regional buildings, called Seismic Transformer (SeT). SeT achieves 92% accury in damage states classification and less than 9% MSE in dynamic response regression, can perform seismic analyses for 3,000 buildings within 3 seconds.
